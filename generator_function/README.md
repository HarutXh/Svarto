# Generator Functions
Generators are written just like a normal function but we use yield() instead of return() for returning a result. It is more powerful as a tool to implement iterators. Unlike regular functions which on encountering a return statement terminates entirely, generators use a yield statement in which the state of the function is saved from the last call and can be picked up or resumed the next time we call a generator function.

# Difference between Generator function and Normal function
- In generator functions, there are one or more yield functions, whereas, in Normal functions, there is only one function
- When the generator function is called, the normal function pauses its execution, and the call is transferred to the generator function.
- Local variables and their states are remembered between successive calls.
